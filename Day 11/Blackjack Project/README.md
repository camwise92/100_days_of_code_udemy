# Blackjack Game

A simple command-line Blackjack game implemented in Python.

## Description

This project is a Python implementation of the classic card game Blackjack (also known as 21). The game allows you to play against a computer-controlled dealer. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over, while also having a higher score than the dealer.

## Features

- Random card dealing.
- Automatic score calculation.
- Handles Blackjack (21 with two cards) and Ace value switching (11 or 1).
- Play multiple rounds.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script.
2. The game will deal two cards to you and two cards to the dealer (one card of the dealer is hidden).
3. You can choose to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep your current hand).
4. The dealer will automatically draw cards until their score is at least 17.
5. The game will compare your score to the dealer's score and declare a winner.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the Python script.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
3. Run the script using the command:
   ```bash
   python blackjack.py
