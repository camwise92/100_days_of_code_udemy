# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
#It is looping through numbs 1 to 20 and when the iteration is on num 20 it prints a statement,
# otherwise it does nothing. But currently it is not outputting anything.
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"? when the iteration is at numb 20
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
# that i will reach the number 20
