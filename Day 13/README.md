Debugging Practice
About
This repository contains small programs purely for me to practice debugging. They are not meant for actual use, and they don’t serve any specific purpose beyond helping me improve my problem-solving skills.

Contents
The repository includes various scripts with intentional or unintentional bugs that I work through as part of my debugging practice. Some may be simple logic errors, while others might involve more complex issues.

Notes
These programs are not optimized or intended for public use.

The code may be messy, incomplete, or broken by design.

Feel free to ignore this repo—it's just for my own learning.
